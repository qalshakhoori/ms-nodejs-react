# React Blog Client: A Modern Microservices-Based Blogging Frontend

This project is a React-based client application for a microservices blog platform. It provides a responsive and interactive user interface for creating posts and managing comments, demonstrating modern web development practices with React and microservices architecture.

The application features real-time post creation and comment management capabilities, leveraging React's component-based architecture and state management. It communicates with backend microservices through RESTful APIs, providing a seamless user experience for blog content management.

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
- Docker (if running containerized)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Installation

#### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd blog-ms/client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

#### Docker Setup
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t blog-client .

# Run Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 blog-client
```

### Quick Start

1. Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Create a new post:
```javascript
// Example using PostCreate component
const post = {
  title: "My First Blog Post"
};
// Submit using the form interface
```

### More Detailed Examples

#### Creating Posts
```javascript
// Using the PostCreate component
const PostCreate = () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
  
  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    await axios.post('http://posts.com/posts/create', { title });
    setTitle('');
  };
  // ... rest of the component
};
```

#### Displaying Posts
```javascript
// Using the PostList component
const PostList = () => {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState({});
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchPosts = async () => {
      const res = await axios.get('http://posts.com/posts');
      setPosts(res.data);
    };
    fetchPosts();
  }, []);
  // ... rest of the component
};
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. API Connection Errors
   - Error: "Failed to fetch posts"
   - Solution: Verify that the backend services are running and accessible
   - Check the API endpoint configuration in PostList.js and PostCreate.js

2. CORS Issues
   - Error: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header missing"
   - Solution: Ensure proper CORS configuration on the backend services
   - Verify that the API endpoints are correctly configured

3. Development Server Issues
   - Error: "Cannot start development server"
   - Solution:
     ```bash
     # Clear npm cache
     npm cache clean --force
     # Remove node_modules and reinstall
     rm -rf node_modules
     npm install
     ```

## Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern where user actions trigger API calls to the backend services, which then update the UI state through React's state management.

```ascii
User Input → React Component → API Call → Backend Service
     ↑                                          |
     |                                          |
     └──────── State Update ←─────── Response ──┘
```

Component Interactions:
- PostCreate sends POST requests to create new blog posts
- PostList fetches and displays all posts through GET requests
- CommentCreate handles comment creation for specific posts
- CommentList displays comments associated with each post
- All components use axios for API communication
- State management is handled through React hooks (useState, useEffect)
